# Q: Why does SmokeTest connect Arithmetic Smoke Test to Test Framework?

## Answer

Expanded from original query via vocab: [smoke, test, arithmetic, unittest]. The graph shows test_script.py imports unittest (test_script.py:L1), contains SmokeTest (L4), and SmokeTest has method test_basic_arithmetic (L5). The bridge is the shared source file test_script.py, not a direct edge between SmokeTest and unittest.

## Outcome

- Signal: useful

## Source Nodes

- SmokeTest
- test_script.py
- unittest
- .test_basic_arithmetic
